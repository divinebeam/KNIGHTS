CURRENTLY
	implementing consumables
		elixer of life
	implementing info display on unit icons
		make it local, display shield stuff, etc.
	implementing juyet quest
	need to implement some sort of flag system to make it so units cant be double damaged by the same weapon
	store flags for weapon array positions?


TODO
	hints at the beginning when you die
	PROJECTILE SYSTEM: trail images, orbiting opposing image, acceleration, orbit images, projectile target, projectile turn amount towards target etc.
	display stats on upgrade icons on unit
	remove players flag from unit items if they leave the game.
	maybe in the future have to guarantee that check terrain collider unit cannot unburrow
	in the future I could make it so that projectile timed properties could be set to some huge time so that the first ones can be used with no problem
	in the future make it so that damage at position can have multiple shapes
	make it so that units can have "hit by weapon" flags to keep things from doing double damage.
	make it so that when the day resets, enemies cant spawn right on top of you and fuck you up.
	show cooldowns
	for dropping item units should make a "dropped item buffer" where items can exist and are constantly spammed to drop and only drop once they can.
	in the future belt system could remember your preference of where to put items by not deleting depleted item ids from the slots, could use that info to direct the auto equip.
	refactor to check PVariable values as little as possible. Do not abuse array[index] as much as possible.
	refactor in main player loop to get PVariable array values once and then use const or var throughout the loop.
	mission objectives should have some controls
	refactor to get all data from an array at the beginning of the loop, instead of keeping accessing the data over and over.
	refactor to make it so projectiles can have preset configurations so I dont have to repeat code for configurations of the same type.

	what if the maze had randomized teleporters
	what if when you reach certain amounts of kills you get proficiency in killing certain monsters
	sight range increase is good for spellcaster and ranger builds
	hybrid or specializations when you have an equal amount at a threshold for certain skills
	secondarys should drop from the first bosses
	what if blood moon happens every 5 or 10 days
	what if blood moon starts with a meteor dropping and the impact site is some random event.
	what if strength makes you faster with big weapons and dexterity makes you faster with small weapons
	what if trolls or giants or golems had ground pound abilities, or ground spike abilities.
	what if sometimes caves can be invaded with hordes of creatures all at once
	what if the end boss is basically the players fighting on top of a hill against endless waves of enemies and when you finally die you ascend
		maybe theres a kill count and players can compete to get the most kills before dying
	what if certain things stunted your armor recovery, like hits from players, or explosions

STORY
	what if this place is a giant floating island in the sky that is the second stage before ascending to an eternal battle ground.
	normal life is below and eternal battle is above. But the reality of it is that its a type of planet with floating islands surrounding it that only certain kinds
	of people can ascend to. Or maybe the most powerful people on the planet have access to some kind of special technology or magic that allows them to ascend to these
	islands. The whole reality of the planet below is just preparation for defense from ethereal alien invaders from space hell or something.
	The floating island the player is inhabiting is sort of a training ground to ascend further to join the defense of the planet. The people below are all ignorant
	of this defense and totally unaware and they just believe the greatest warriors are going on some great crusade or journey into the sky to never return.
	Which they are, but the details are left out. The floating island which the game takes place on has captured creatures from the stars that get are controlled
	by greater warriors watching the players from above. The rank you're given at the end of your trial determines where you are placed in the heavenly battle.
	If you successfully remove the "thorn" from the land you are chosen and you will ascend to join the heavenly battle as a glorious warrior.
